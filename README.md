# Concentrators-and-Completers-Calculator-
These are compilation of macros used to go from the raw data that is pulled from PowerSchool and then quickly turned into data that can be uploaded back to PowerSchool.  The macro takes the courses that he student took and increments them specifically to what the requirements are for a concentrator and a completer within each program of study.
